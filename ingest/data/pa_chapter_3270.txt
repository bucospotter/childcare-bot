Notes of Decisions

The Department of Public Welfare’s repeated failure to make timely inspections of day care center
which it concealed by issuing provisional certificates based on technical or pretextual deficiencies,
then granting retroactive certificates of compliance, enabled the Department to evade scrutiny of
operator’s appeal of issuance of provisional certificates of compliance by dismissing operator’s
appeal as moot. Musheno v. Department of Public Welfare, 829 A.2d 1228, 1232—1233 (Pa.
Cmwilth. 2003). Such conduct by the Department raised important public issues, such as official
competency, candor and accountability, which survive mootness. /d. at 1233.
